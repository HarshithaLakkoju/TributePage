Chief Gurbachan Singh Salaria was a part of the UN’s group to spare the nation from Katangese rebels who were wrecking destruction, and participated in an operation that left the foe totally dampened. Salaria died at the young age of 26 in an unknown land. However, his actions were recognized by the Indian government, and Chief Salaria was honored with the Param Vir Chakra, India’s most astounding wartime military honor, for his grit in the Congo War in 1961.
